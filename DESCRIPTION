Description: The functions compute the double-entry intraclass correlation, which is an index of profile similarity (Furr, 2010; McCrae, 2008). The double-entry intraclass correlation is a more precise index of the agreement of two empirically observed profiles than the often-used intraclass correlation (McCrae, 2008). Profiles comprising correlations are automatically transformed according to the Fisher z-transformation before the double-entry intraclass correlation is calculated. If the profiles comprise scores such as sum scores from various personality scales, it is recommended to standardize each individual score prior to computation of the double-entry intraclass correlation (McCrae, 2008). See Furr (2010) <doi:10.1080/00223890903379134> or McCrae (2008) <doi:10.1080/00223890701845104> for details.
