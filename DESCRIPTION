Description: The function computes the double-entry intraclass correlation, which is an index of profile similarity (Furr, 2010; McCrae, 2008). The double-entry intraclass correlation is a more precise index of the agreement of two empirically observed profiles than the often-used intraclass correlation (McCrae, 2008). The function transforms profiles comprising correlations according to the Fisher z-transformation before the double-entry intraclass correlation is calculated. If the profiles comprise scores such as sum scores from various personality scales, it is recommended to standardize each individual score before entering into the function (McCrae, 2008). See Furr (2010) <doi:10.1080/00223890903379134> or McCrae (2008) <doi:10.1080/00223890701845104> for details.
