Description: The function computes the profile similarity measure double-entry intraclass correlation. It is a more precise index of the agreement of two
    empirically observed profiles than the often used intraclass correlation or profile correlation. Profiles comprising correlations are transformed         according to the Fisher z transformation before the index is calculated. In the case of score data with different scale formats (e.g., if the profile        contains different IQ or a variety of personality tests), it is recommended to z-standardize the scores before entering into the function. For details,     see Furr (2010) <doi:10.1080/00223890903379134> or McCrae (2008) <doi:10.1080/00223890701845104>.
