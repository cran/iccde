\title{Computation of Double-Entry Intraclass Correlations for correlation
matrices}
\usage{
icc.de.mat(dat)
}

\arguments{
\item{dat}{A symmetric c x c correlation matrix. It can be easily computed with
the basic R function 'cor()'. Assymetric matrices with different numbers of
columns and rows are not supported.}
}

\description{
This function computes pairwise double-entry intraclass correlations among
all entries of a symmetric correlation matrix. Correlations between the compared
variables as well as correlations of the constructs with themselves are thereby
excluded (i.e., correlations between X and Y, correlation between X and X, and
between correlation between Y and Y).}

\value{
\item{iccde}{Double-Entry Intraclass Correlation}}
