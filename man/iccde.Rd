\title{Computation of the Double-Entry Intraclass Correlation}
\usage{
icc.de(prof1, prof2, input = c("cor", "score"), digits = 2)
}

\arguments{
\item{prof1}{Vector of components of the nomological network of the first trait
(input = "cor") or vector of components of the first profile (input = "score").}
\item{prof2}{Vector of components of the nomological network of the second trait
(input = "cor") or vector of components of the second profile (input = "score").}
\item{input}{Do the profiles contain correlations (e.g., from nomological
network; input = "cor") or scores from different scales (e.g., sum scores from
diverse personality tests; input = "score")? The default is input = "cor".}
\item{digits}{Number of digits in the output. The default is digits = 2.}
}

\description{
The function computes the double-entry intraclass correlation,
which is an index of profile similarity (Furr, 2010; McCrae, 2008).
The double-entry intraclass correlation is a more precise index of the agreement
of two empirically observed profiles than the often-used intraclass correlation
(McCrae, 2008). The function transforms profiles comprising correlations
according to the Fisher z-transformation before the double-entry intraclass
correlation is calculated. If the profiles comprise scores such as sum scores
from various personality scales, it is recommended to standardize each
individual score before entering into the function (McCrae, 2008). In case of
missing values, the function will automatically use pairwise deletion. See
Furr (2010) <doi:10.1080/00223890903379134> or
McCrae (2008) <doi:10.1080/00223890701845104> for details.
