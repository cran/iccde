\title{Computation of Double-Entry Intraclass Correlation}
\usage{
icc.de(prof1, prof2, input = c("cor", "score"), digits = 3)
}

\arguments{
\item{prof1}{Vector of components of the nomological network of the first trait
(input = "cor") or vector of components of the first profile (input = "score")}
\item{prof2}{Vector of components of the nomological network of the second trait
(input = "cor") or vector of components of the second profile (input = "score")}
\item{digits}{Number of digits in the output of the function, DEFAULT = 3}
\item{input}{Do the profiles contain correlations (e.g., from construct
validation) or test scores on different scales (e.g., from diverse personality
tests)?}
}

\description{The function computes the profile similarity measure double-entry
intraclass correlation. It is a more precise index of the agreement of two
empirically observed profiles than the often used intraclass correlation or
profile correlation. Profiles comprising correlations are transformed according
to the Fisher z transformation before the index is calculated. In the case of
score data with different scale formats (e.g., if the profile contains
different IQ or a variety of personality tests), it is recommended to
z-standardize the scores before entering into the function. For details, see
